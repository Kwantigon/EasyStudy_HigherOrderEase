# About
This is a repository with sources for the paper *EasyStudy: Framework for Easy Deployment of User Studies on Recommender Systems*

# About EasyStudy
A framework for quick & easy deployment of customizable RS user studies. The framework is modular, highly extensible and easy to use. It offers out-of-the-box functionality for all phases of the user study, i.e., data loading and presentation, preference elicitation, baseline recommending algorithms as well as result comparison layouts. It also features a  *fastcompare* plugin implementing the most common study flow, i.e., comparing perceived utility of several personalized recommenders.

Alternatively we have prepared a recording that shows a quick walkthrough of the framework, where we first show the "researcher view" to use Administration in order to create a simple user study, then show participant view (pass through the study itself) and briefly explain where the interactions can be found.
