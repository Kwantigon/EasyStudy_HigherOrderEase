# About

This repository contains my implementation for the semestral work for the subject \[NSWII166\] Introduction to recommender systems and user preferences.

The algorithm implemented is a higher-order EASE algorithm based on the paper: https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3460231.3474273.

Additionally, I will implement a post-processing method that boosts diversity.
For now, I'm not sure which method it will be.
